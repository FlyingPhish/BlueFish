BlueFish is a Python-based automation tool designed to simplify the analysis of PCAP (Packet Capture) files. It leverages the power of Wireshark's command-line tool, tshark, to extract valuable information from network captures. With BlueFish, you can quickly identify potential login attempts, analyze network traffic patterns, and extract various network artifacts.
