# BlueFish

BlueFish is a Python-based automation tool designed to simplify the analysis of PCAP (Packet Capture) files. It leverages the power of Wireshark's command-line tool, tshark, to extract valuable information from network captures. With BlueFish, you can quickly identify potential login attempts, analyze network traffic patterns, and extract various network artifacts.

### Key Features:
* Extracts potential login attempts and credentials.
* Analyzes IP and MAC addresses.
* Retrieves embedded objects from network traffic.
* Identifies email addresses and HTTP requests.
* Provides insights into protocols, DNS queries, ICMP packets, SMB operations, FTP sessions, and TLS handshakes.
* BlueFish streamlines the process of PCAP analysis, making it easier for security professionals and network analysts to gain insights into network activities.
